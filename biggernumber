#      2) Is n1 is greater than n2 and n3, if yes 
#         print n1 is bigest no goto step 5, otherwise goto next step
#      3) Is n2 is greater than n1 and n3, if yes 
#         print n2 is bigest no goto step 5, otherwise goto next step
#      4) Is n3 is greater than n1 and n2, if yes 
#         print n3 is bigest no goto step 5, otherwise goto next step
